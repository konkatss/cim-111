      </h2>

    <p> I am interested in Social Developmental psychology Research. I am looking for a summer internship at a research lab or a child care center in order to gain hands-on experience. This experience will allow me to gain high-end professional knowledge in a field I am higlhy invested on, and I am considering following in graduate school. It will help me decide what exact field in psychology I want to pursue in the future. I will also further enhance my verbal and writing skills that are necessary for professional development. I am hoping that research experience will greatly strengthen my application to graduate school and if I do enter grad school with the sophistication gained from working in a laboratory, I will be more successful as a graduate student. I want to contribute to the creation of knowledge and get useful and interesting data that will further the research of our group and hopefully publish a work that will make an impact in the childhood development hypothesis, which if applied, can deliver great results.

    I am a first-generation college student, born and raised in Greece, which makes me a great addition to a diverse psychology community. I have volunteered for 3 years to a child care center, Agios Dimitrios, in Greece, with children with mental disorders. I was also granted access to explore the most serious mental health facility, with people with dangerous disorders, where only licensed professionals were allowed to enter. My experience in Agios Dimitrios those 3 years was life changing, and led me to want to pursue a career in psychology.
    I have also been a STEM teaching assistant to a summer camp "Anatolia College Rainbow Camp" in Greece for pre-kindergarten kids, where I had to effectively teach them science in ways that would fit each student. I dealt with children with very challenging behaviors, where I found ways to take the aggression out on more creative ways.
    I have also briefly volunteered at the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind with kids around the age of 5.

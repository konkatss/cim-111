<p> I am interested in a  Human Resources (HR) Summer Analyst Position, because I am always seeking for projects that need innovative and creative strategies and I want real-word experience in human resources. After my chats with some experienced HR professionals, I realized I want to focus on the growth and potential success of an organization’s people.

I am a first-generation college student, born and raised in Greece, which makes me a great addition to a diverse community. I have interned in many different industries and I have interacted with many human resources teams, realizing that the employees of a company are their most important asset. I am eager to learn the ropes from globally minded HR professionals and make an impact by exceeding their obligations.



</p>
<p>I have built long-lasting relationships with global clients and will do so with the employees of an organization. I have dealt with immediate success with complex challenges, including protests against the clients, media crisis etc., rendering me qualified to overcome real-world, business challenges, with the help of a team.

I want to find the cutting-edge approaches to not only manage, but attract and develop an organization’s most important asset, its employees. I am thrilled to play a role in positioning a company as one of the top employers in the world. Having worked in different environments, I realize the difference in productivity levels in a positive versus a negative work environment.
